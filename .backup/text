mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0010893-0011646 forest reserves and factories there are many different versions concerning the origins of the name bukit batok
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0011677-0012271 but what is clear is that according to the malay language bukit means hill and batok means cough
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0012352-0012766 a possible explanation for being conferred the name batok
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0012822-0013006 was the cold air
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0013013-0013349 in the area that cause cough and cold
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0013438-0013922 there are several other explanations concerning the use of the term batok
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0013940-0014446 according to one version which can be traced to the japanese village chief
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0014479-0014825 in the tiny village of gassing coconut trees
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0014857-0015322 grew on the hills in this area and hence the term batok
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0015379-0015600 the japanese term for coconuts
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0015685-0016147 the chinese interpretation says that the hills were of solid granite
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0016160-0016525 and hence called batu the malay name for stone
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0016550-0016929 which had been mispronounced as bato and finally batok
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0017007-0017702 however another interpretation points to the blasting of the granite quarries which sounded as though the hills were coughing
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0017799-0018589 yet another version argues that the hill resemble a skull top and batok could also be construed to mean skull top
mml_24_jan_2018_a_session4_2-0018642-0019044 however these expectations are very difficult to verify
